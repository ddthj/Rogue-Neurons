# Rogue-Neurons
A test of implementing ML decision making into hardcoded bots
By GooseFairy/ddthj
Prepared for Professor Stansbury

Setup:

This bot runs on Python 3.6 and requires the following:
-RLBot Version 1.14.12
-Keras 2.2.4
-Pygame 1.9.4
-Rocket League (Not latest version!). 'download_depot 252950 252951 6062228629972172324.' is the rolled-back copy that was used to test this bot

The "Old GUI" / Creator GUI for python:

It is important to note that the Keras model will be loaded from the directory that RLBot is run from, so the .h5 and .dat must be in the same folder as run-gui.bat

It should also be known that to train the model in mode 1 you must have the game in windowed mode so you can tab over the Rogue's gui to input keypresses
